From The Shadows is a game where the player takes control of a shinobi on a revenge mission. When infiltrating, the player must maintain stealth but can use the shadows to their advantage. By submerging themselves into the shadows the player can move around without being seen however they must stay clear of light sources otherwise you will be thrown out of the shadows.
