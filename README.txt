Our demo is staged primarily in a small village at night. This is the best time for assissins, like our character, to carry out their missions so we felt a dim setting would add to the atmosphere. We used a big level design to give the player a chance to be creative on how to get around the guards in the village. 

We use lights attached to paper lanterns throughout the village to see.
We have fire particle effects in braziers to act as spotlights to know where to head for the objective.
Ethan wrote a waypoint script to allow for guards to follow set paths using navmeshes, and a controller for the guards to follow the waypoints moving over walkable terrain.
Jamil wrote the Mecanim for the walking guard that would be in the village and the Mecanim for the idle guards in the village. 
Lisset wrote the Mecanim that would be for the player when they move their character.
