our demo is staged primarily in a small town. the scene is during the night, so we have lights through paper lantern assets in order to see. 
We have fire particle effects in braziers to act as spotlights to know where to head for the objective.
I (Ethan) wrote a waypoint script to allow for guards to follow set paths using navmeshes, and a controller for the guards to follow the waypoints moving over walkable terrain.
